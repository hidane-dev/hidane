# Oracle scripts

Small scripts that ask the **official** Firestore emulator how it behaves, so hidane can
reproduce the answer. Each one writes a fixture that a hidane test reads; the fixture is
committed, the official jar is not (it may not be redistributed, see `docs/parity-exceptions.md`).

Python 3 standard library only. Run them against a freshly started official emulator:

```sh
java -jar cloud-firestore-emulator-v1.22.0.jar --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8086 &
python3 -I tools/oracle/value_order.py 127.0.0.1:8086 > crates/hidane-core/tests/fixtures/value_order.json
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8086/shutdown
```

| Script | Question | Fixture | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `value_order.py` + `value_order_cases.json` | How are values ordered, which values are equal, and how are document names ordered in a collection group? | `crates/hidane-core/tests/fixtures/value_order.json` | `crates/hidane-core/tests/official_order.rs` |
